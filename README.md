# ArkNet


## About

ArkNet is a course project(Java 2) in 2024 Spring semester in SUSTech. We hope to design a desk app to implement Web addresses management. Now we have achieved several functions.

Something is yet done. Some algorithms are going to be improve. But sorry that I don't have enough time for the improvement.

We offer some API here, using JavaFX to draw the UI.

## Running

To run this app, find the path `src/main/java/org/example/demofx/MainApp.java` and execute it. All operations are on UI windows (nothing in command line)

## TODO List

- [x] Debug on the mode switch problem (cannot switch from night mode to day mode)
- [ ] UI appearance improvement
- [ ] search algorithm (change to KMP or more efficient and accurate one)
- [ ] set up security storage(username and pwd still visible)
- [ ] Add more functions
- [ ] User's manual
