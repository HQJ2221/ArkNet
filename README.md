# ArkNet


## About

ArkNet is a course project(Java 2) in 2024 Spring semester in SUSTech. We hope to design a desk app to implement Web addresses management. Now we have achieved several functions.

The basic functions and core features are implemented. UI and other optimizations are waiting to be improved. 

We offer some API here, using JavaFX to draw the UI.

## Running

To run this app, find the path `src/main/java/org/example/demofx/MainApp.java` and execute it. All operations are on UI windows (nothing in command line)

## TODO List

- [x] Debug on the mode switch problem (cannot switch from night mode to day mode)
- [ ] UI appearance improvement
- [ ] search algorithm (change to KMP or more efficient and accurate one)
- [ ] set up security storage(username and pwd still visible)
- [ ] Add more functions
- [ ] User's manual
