# ArkNet


## About

ArkNet is a course project(Java 2) in 2024 Spring semester in SUSTech. We hope to design a desk app to implement Web addresses management. Now we have achieved several functions.

Something is yet done. Some algorithms are going to be improve. But sorry that I don't have enough time for the improvement.

We offer some API here, using JavaFX to draw the UI.



## TODO List

- UI appearance improvement
- search algorithm (change to KMP or more efficient and accurate one)
- set up security storage(username and pwd still visible)
- Add more functions
